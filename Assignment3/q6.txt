The flow of both the programs are very different.

1)  The first thing that came to mind is the difference in the number of lines.
q4(with oops) took 114 lines whereas q5 took about 70 lines.

2) q4 took 0.0014252662658691406s and q5 took 0.0010149478912353516

3)  But one more thing I noticed among the two codes are that: q4 is able to handle mutliple
courses with relative ease compared to q5 because different courses have different objects
with attributes and methods that makes it much easier to handle.
