Advantages of using OO
1. OOPs have an advantage over dictionary when it comes to modularity.
2. Multiple courses can be handled faster with OOPs than dictionaries.

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. Dictionaries are faster to use when it comes to accessing/getting a value because of its hashing feature.
2. The code using dictionaries have an edge over OOPs when it comes to time


Disadvantage of using OO
1. OOPs is not suitable for all type of programs
2. Makes code much bigger in size

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1. Harder to handle multiple courses.
2. Dictionaries contain a key-value pair but there are cases when one key should be linked to multiple attributes which is done faster in OOPs

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1000
2. Time by OO: 1.5311810970306396
3. Time by dictionary: 1.4167659282684326
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 0.074723472608229
